Pattern recognition is the automated recognition of patterns and regularities in data. 
It has applications in statistical data analysis, signal processing, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning. 
Pattern recognition has its origins in statistics and engineering; some modern approaches to pattern recognition include the use of machine learning, due to the increased availability of big data and a new abundance of processing power. 
These activities can be viewed as two facets of the same field of application, and they have undergone substantial development over the past few decades.
Pattern recognition systems are commonly trained from labeled "training" data. 
When no labeled data are available, other algorithms can be used to discover previously unknown patterns. 
KDD and data mining have a larger focus on unsupervised methods and stronger connection to business use. 
Pattern recognition focuses more on the signal and also takes acquisition and Signal Processing into consideration. 
It originated in engineering, and the term is popular in the context of computer vision: a leading computer vision conference is named Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.
